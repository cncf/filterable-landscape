[![CNCF Landscape Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncf/artwork/master/other/cncf-landscape/horizontal/color/cncf-landscape-horizontal-color.png)](https://github.com/cncf/artwork/blob/master/other/cncf-landscape/horizontal/color/cncf-landscape-horizontal-color.png)

This is a CNCF project to provide an interactive version of the static landscape from https://github.com/cncf/landscape#current-version.

## Data

The canonical source for all data is [landscape.yml](landscape.yml). Once a day, we download data for projects and companies from the following sources:

* Project info from GitHub
* Funding info from [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/)
* Market cap data from Yahoo Finance

The build server enhances the source data with the fetched data and saves the result in [processed_landscape.yml](processed_landscape.yml) and as a JSON [file](https://github.com/cncf/filterable-landscape/blob/master/src/data.json), which is what the app loads to display data.

## Corrections

Please open a pull request with edits to [landscape.yml](landscape.yml). The file [processed_landscape.yml](processed_landscape.yml) is generated and so should never be edited directly.

If the error is with data from [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/) you should open an account there and edit the data. If you don't like a project description, edit it in GitHub. If your project isn't showing the license correctly, you may need to paste the license into LICENSE file at the root of your project in GitHub, in order for GitHub to serve the information correctly. (It needs to be LICENSE and not LICENSE.txt or LICENSE.code, and the text needs to be the standard license text.)

## License

This repository contains data received from [Crunchbase](http://www.crunchbase.com). This data is not licensed pursuant to the Apache License, Version 2.0. It is subject to Crunchbaseâ€™s Data Access Terms, available at [https://data.crunchbase.com/v3.1/docs/terms](https://data.crunchbase.com/v3.1/docs/terms), and is only permitted to be used with this CNCF Cloud Native Landscape Project.

Everything else is under the Apache License, Version 2.0, except for project and product logos, which are generally copyrighted by the company that created them, and are simply cached here for reliability.

## Logos

The following rules will produce the most readable and attractive logos:

1. We strongly prefer SVG, as they are smaller, display correctly at any scale, and work on all modern browsers. If you only have the logo in another vector format (like AI, EPS, or PSD), please open as issue and we'll convert it to SVG for you.
1. If it must be a PNG, the dimensions of the source logo need to be at least 450x300, as that is what they are resized to. A transparent background is better; white will be converted to PNG with a transparent background.
1. When multiple variants exist, use stacked (not horizontal) logos. For example, we use the second column (stacked), not the first (horizontal), of CNCF project [logos](https://github.com/cncf/artwork/#cncf-incubating-logos).
1. Don't use reversed logos (i.e., with a non-white, non-transparent background color). If you only have a reversed logo, create an issue with it attached and we'll produce a non-reversed version for you.
1. Logos must include the company, product or project name in English. It's fine to also include words from another language. If you don't have a version of your logo with the name in it, please open an issue and we'll create one for you (and please specify the font).
1. If the name of the product is not in the logo, then the company name should be included in the product name. So an Acme Rocket logo that shows "Rocket" should have product name "Rocket", while if the logo shows "Acme", the product name should be "Acme Rocket". Otherwise, logos looks out of place when you sort alphabetically.
1. Google images is often the best way to find a good version of the logo (but ensure it's the up-to-date version). Search for [project-name logo filetype:svg], click images, click Tools, More Tools, and then Show Sizes. You can then change SVG files to PNG if you can't find a suitable SVG. Or click this [image search link](https://www.google.com/search?q=kubernetes&tbs=ift:svg,imgo:1&tbm=isch) and change the search query.

## Installation

### Install on Mac
1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
2. `brew install node yarn`
3. `git clone git@github.com:cncf/filterable-landscape.git`

### Local development
1. `git pull`
2. `yarn` (installs dependencies)
* `yarn open:src` (starts a development server) or
* `yarn build`, then `yarn open:dist` (compiles and opens a production build)


### Updating data

The following options go from least data updated to most:
1. `npm run fetch`: Fetches images (saving any changes) and updates processed_landscape.yaml
1. `npm run precommit`: Above plus downloads GitHub info
1. `npm run rebuild`: Above plus deletes all images first

Netlify runs:
1. `npm run prebuild` 

### Data flow
  Nothing is updated automatically during development.
  Overall, the data flow is this:

  landscape.yml => `yarn run babel-node tools/addExternalInfo` => processed_landscape.yml => `yarn yaml2json` => src/data.json + src/lookup.json

  processed_landscape.yml => `yarn run babel-node tools/fetchImages` => src/logos + src/styles/styles.scss + src/image_urls.yml

  `yarn run babel-node tools/addExternalInfo` uses these files:
  1. landscape.yml - our source
  2. github.json - an info about repos, can be obtained via `yarn run babel-node tools/fetchGithubStats`
  3. crunchbase.csv - an info about companies from the crunchbase, should be download manually from a crunchbase pro account
  4. cncf_members.yml - a list of all cncf members.

  `yarn yaml2json` uses this files:
  1. processed_landscape.yml - our source with extra fields from saved 3rd party data.

  `yarn run babel-node tools/fetchImages` uses these files:
  1. processed_landscape.yml - our source with extra fields from saved 3rd party data, so we get a proper company name
  2. src/hosted_logos - some logos are stored locally
  3. src/image_urls.yml - result from a previous run of this command. Saves us a time on image postprocessing

  When you change a code iteslf in tools/fetchImages.js, postprocessing may
  fail, because the file src/image_urls.yml contains the hash for an input image.
  Just run `yarn fetchAllImages` to load everything again.

### building a dist
   `yarn build`

### rebuilding json from yaml and extra info:
   `yarn yaml2json`

### rebuilding all images:
   `yarn fetchAllImages`

### adding a custom image:
1. save it to the src/hosted_logos/, for example, src/hosted_logos/apex.png
2. update the landscape.yml with a logo, for exaple, `logo: ./src/hosted_logos/apex.png`
3. handle it as usually when you modify any reference to the image:
  - `npm run fetch`
